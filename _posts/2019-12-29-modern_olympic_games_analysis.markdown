For hundreds of years, the Olympic Games have existed as a cornerstone of entertainment, culture, and international collaboration. Inspired by ancient Greek traditions, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) - founded in 1894 - hosted the first modern games in 1896 in Athens, Greece. Since then, the games have evolved to include the paraolympic games for athletes with disabilities, greater gender equality with in increase in female athletes, and alternating years for the summer and winter games. Able to adapt to changes in culture, technology, and economies, the Olympic Games have strengthened their relevance and impact in our modern world, an iconic symbol of the relationships and camaraderie that exist across political borders.

For my fifth project in Flatiron's data science program, I conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the modern Olympic Games from 1986 to present day. Working with data from over 200,000 athletes, I synthesized this big data into engaging and insightful visualizations that provide us with a deeper look into the impact of the Olympic Games on our society and inform us as to the direction we are headed toward in the future. For our analysis, we divided the EDA into distinct sections - gender, types of athletes, Olympic medalists, participating countries, seasonal athletes, and additional trends over time - with clear research questions to guide each separate notebook. In the introductory notebook, we scrub the original dataframe, accounting for missing values primarily in the height, weight, and age features, and save this cleaned dataframe for use in the other notebooks. Throughout the remainder of the project, we continued with the OSEMN data science framework, proceeding from the "obtain" and "scrub" stages into exploratory analysis, occasional models, and most importantly - interpretation of the results.

Across the scope of the project, we evaluated the following problem statements:
* How have Olympic athletes changed over time?
* How have the Olympic Games changed over time?
* How do the Olympic Games reflect international relations, with regards to politics, economics, and human rights?
With these key questions in mind, we sought to evaluate how the Olympic Games affect our society. The answers to these questions possess tremendous value, as they highlight the Olympics as a catalyst for social and political change, allow us to develop policies to realize the full potential of the Olympics, and provide the foundation for future predicitve work with regards to athlete performance.
