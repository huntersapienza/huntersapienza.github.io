<p>Hi, I'm Hunter! As a data scientist and machine learning engineer, I have a passion for ​bridging the inequality gaps present in our current system through work within socially mindful organizations and responsible data management​. I have experience in data acquisition and data modeling, statistical analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and NLP. With a background in education, I bring strong skills in data analysis, team building, and problem-solving that helps innovative companies make strategic decisions. Via the Flatiron School online bootcamp program, I am building and expanding my knowledge and experience with big data management, analysis, and programming work. This portfolio showcases my journey through the program in the form of projects, journal entries, and online collaborations. Currently, I work as a middle school math teacher at Highbridge Green School in the Bronx as a corps member for Teach For America, with a Master of Arts in Teaching. Through Kode With Klossy, I worked as a summer instructor and discovered my passion for programming and data science.  I graduated from University of Washington in the Interdisciplinary Honors Program with a Bachelor of Arts in human geography and a minor in mathematics, primarily focusing on urbanization, city development, and queer/feminist geographies. I'm fascinated by data management, mapping, and geographic information systems, especially in applications related to city planning, population demographics, and how contemporary urbanization processes produce city spaces. As a social justice activist and strong believer in the power of data, I hope to utilize the data produced by our daily society to bridge the inequality gaps present in our current system through work within socially mindful organizations and responsible data management. Beyond these involvements, I enjoy running, getting outdoors, practicing/teaching yoga, exploring the city, and drinking copious amounts of coffee.</p>
